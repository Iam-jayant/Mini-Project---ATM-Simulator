I created this Mini ATM Simulator as a beginner-friendly project using Java. My main goal was to build something practical while learning GUI development in Java. I already knew the backend logic, like handling deposits, withdrawals, and PIN authentication, but I needed help with making a proper graphical interface (since I was new to GUI development). So, I took help from AI to understand and implement the JFrame-based GUI while keeping the backend logic my own.

Tech Used:
Java (Core) â€“ For all the backend logic, including balance updates, PIN verification, and transactions.
JFrame (Swing) â€“ For creating the graphical interface instead of using the console.
GitHub â€“ To share my project and make it accessible to others.
Features:
âœ… Login with Card Number & PIN (basic authentication)
âœ… Deposit & Withdraw Money (with balance update)
âœ… Balance Inquiry (Secure) â€“ Requires a transaction PIN for security
âœ… Simple UI â€“ A popup-based ATM simulator instead of console-based execution

Why I Built This?
I wanted to upgrade my previous Mini ATM console project into something more interactive. Since Iâ€™m learning Java and just starting with GUI, this was a good hands-on project. It also helped me understand how real-world banking systems might work at a basic level.
